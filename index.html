                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello there! I'm Gimhani Nilnuwani, as a highly motivated and detail-oriented undergraduate pursuing a degree as
Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Information Technology at University of Jaffna.<p>Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired a strong foundation in IT
principles, including proficiency in programming languages (C, C++, Java, C#, Python,MIPS,R and Prolog), database management, web development (HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, PHP, Spring Boot), knowledge-based programming (Prolog) and software development. My coursework has equipped me with a solid understanding of Bioinformatics and computational biology, Agent-based computing, Compiler design,
Data science, Machine learning, Smart system (IOT), and Computer architecture and I am excited about the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a real-world setting. </p>
                
<p>What sets me apart is my technical skills and ability to collaborate effectively in a team environment. As demonstrated through my involvement in a Group project in an Automated water dispensing system, a Group project in Forum App development, a Partnership development team in AIESEC at University of Jaffna, IEEE committee events, and Hackathon competitions I have sharpened my communication and
problem-solving skills, enabling me to contribute positively to collaborative projects.</p>
<p>One of the unique aspects of my university experience is having lived in a multicultural society, where I had the opportunity to interact with and adapt to different cultural backgrounds. This environment has not only enriched my personal
growth but has also equipped me with the ability to communicate effectively with individuals from diverse cultures. This cultural adaptability is a valuable asset in today's globalized workplace.
